💬 Parys WhatsApp Bot – Public Setup Guide

> Welcome! This bot was built to help locals in Parys, South Africa find nearby services like plumbers, tutors, hairdressers, etc. It runs using Python, a free WhatsApp API (like Twilio), and works even if you're just using your phone.



🚀 What Does This Bot Do?

You send a message like:

> I need a plumber
Find a bakery in Tumahole



The bot replies with a local business listing from a file. You control the listings using a simple text file (services.txt), and it does the rest.

✅ Setup Instructions

1. Install Python packages

> On Replit / PythonAnywhere / Laptop:



pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Add business listings to services.txt

Here’s an example:

type: plumber  
name: Tumahole Pipes  
phone: 0812345678  
location: Tumahole  
note: 24/7 emergency plumbing  
sponsored: no

You can add more — just copy/paste and change the details.


3. Convert TXT ➜ JSON (bot format)

> From inside the magic-tool/ folder, run:



bash make.sh

It will:

✅ Check for missing fields

💾 Make a backup

🪄 Convert to services.json

📝 Save a log file in logs/



4. Test the Bot

> Run the bot locally:



python app.py

You should see:

Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000


5. Connect to WhatsApp (via Twilio)

1. Create an account at twilio.com/whatsapp


2. Activate the sandbox


3. From your phone, send the join code to Twilio


4. In the sandbox webhook settings, paste this:



https://your-deployment-url.com/whatsapp

⚠️ If you're using Replit or Netlify, deploy first and update the link.


6. Talk to It From WhatsApp

Try these messages:

I need a plumber  
Find me a tutor  
Bakery in Tumahole

If your data is loaded and everything worked, the bot will respond.


🔧 Bonus Scripts (Optional)

bash backup.sh → Save a manual JSON backup

bash save-version.sh → Save a labeled snapshot

bash auto-ping.sh → Trigger Netlify to rebuild the live site

bash auto-ping-Telegram-Whatsapp.sh → Notify bot about an update

python json_to_txt.py → Restore TXT from JSON if you lose your edits

python verify.py → Run a test check without making changes




💡 Useful Tips

sponsored: yes puts a listing at the top of search results

Use short clear categories like: baker, hairdresser, taxi, mechanic

You can expand this to other towns later — it's fully editable

Use logs/ to track what changed, when, and if something broke


😵‍💫 If You Get Lost

> 🔍 “I don’t know what I’m doing anymore...”



It’s okay. Happens to the best of us.
Just scroll back up, read slower — and if all else fails:

> Ask ChatGPT like:
“Hey, I’m working on the Parys WhatsApp bot and I broke something”



Seriously. You’ll probably get better help than from your cousin who “did IT” in 2013.
